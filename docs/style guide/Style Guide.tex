\section{Indentation}

We use tabs. In an IDE where we can specify, we use a tab width of four spaces.\\

\section{Braces}

Opening braces are placed on the same line as the structure that uses them.\\
There is normally a blank line before a closing brace.\\

\section{Class structure}

Related methods are grouped together. Such groups are visibly separated with comments.\\
All the class fields are at the start of the class.\\
After that, there come the constructors.\\
In the middle are the remaining methods.\\
All getters and setters are at the very end of the class.\\
